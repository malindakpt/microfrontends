## Overview

This project is used for testing `id-service` integration flows. It will behave
as a typical react app which will integrate with the id-service using the
`id-link` plugin to authenticate users and authorize access.

## Starting Up the Portal

- Make sure the id-service is already running
- Make a copy of the .env.template as `.env` and set the correct id-service
  configuration parameters
- Run the `start` package script
