# Axinom CMS UI Library

This libary provides the building blocks for building CMS frontend applications.

On a high level, the components can be divided into two groups:

* __Primary Components__ - These components are the primary candidates used for building CMS applications. 
  They are designed to provide a consistent user experience, reduce the amount of code needed to get great
  user interactions, and provide a consistent workflow layout through out your application.

* __Other Components__ - These components are mainly the building blocks used by the primary components 
  to implement their behavior. It is possible to use them standalone to implement advanced use cases. 
  However, for standard use cases, the components listed above are the better choice as they require 
  less manual wiring to get a good user experience.

This documentation describes the functionalities of the components and provides guides
on how to implement common use cases.
